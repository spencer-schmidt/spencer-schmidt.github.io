I helped the UF swamp launch rocket team to develop a motor propulsion test stand in the spring of 2022. Throughout the project I got experience with non-traditional manufacturing techniques, MATLAB coding, CAD modeling, and with working in a team and delegating tasks.

Vacay is implemented using [Meteor](http://meteor.com), a JavaScript application platform. Within two weeks, we created a website that implements several types of reservations including flights, hotels, and car rentals.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
