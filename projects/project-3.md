In March of 2020, like many others, I left school and headed home. My classes continued online but I still wanted to keep learning in a hands-on way, so when I left, I brought an outboard motor that had fallen into disrepair, intending to fix it. Over the course of a few weeks, I read up on forums and watched videos to learn what I needed. I determined that the engine needed a new impeller for the coolant pump, and that the wiring for the killswtich needed to be mended. I ordered the parts and was able to successfully replace the impeller, fix the wiring, change the engine oil, and give the motor a tune-up. This introductory experience taught me a lot about motors and about the way things are designed in general.

Then, in the fall, my roommate bought a broken down scooter and asked me to look into repairing it. I again did lots of research, and was able to get the scooter running by replacing the carburator, changing the battery, and installing new spark plugs. Now that everyone is back to campus, I am in charge of repairing the outboard motors for the salt-water fishing club, and I offer my help to anyone who asks. I feel that taking up this hobby has given me insight into the side of mechanical design that most of my classmates never get. I plan to continue repairing engines whenever I can, and I am grateful for the experience and practical skills this activity gives me.

Below is a picture of the outboard motors I maintain, and a picture from when I repaired the scooter:
